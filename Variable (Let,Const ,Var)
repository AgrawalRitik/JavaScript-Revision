** Var  -> Functional Scope        --> Avoid it , as suppose userPassword is changed in for loop will cause trouble as it is accessed globally.
**let  -> block scope
**const -> final (fixed) scope


** IF variable is declared only not initialised give undefined
let user;    --> console.log(user) -> undefined.
